.SYNOPSIS
  This routine is to generate a random number between 1 and "MaximumRandom(180); if the Configuration Item is run daily, approximately twice a year it is expected
  that a client will randomly pick a value of 1, and trigger a RefreshServercomplianceState
.DESCRIPTION
 Certainly! Let's rephrase the provided information about the script and its usage in a more concise manner:

- Purpose of the Script:
  - This script serves as a "Detection" script within a **Configuration Item**.
  - When used in a detect-only mode, any value returned is considered compliant.

- Deployment and Frequency:
  - Configuration Manager Administrators typically add this script to a baseline.
  - The baseline is deployed daily to Windows OS-based devices.
  - These devices scan for or deploy patches using the Software Updates Feature.

- Random Trigger and Reset:
  - With a `MaximumRandom` number of 180, a client may trigger the "ResetServerComplianceState" approximately twice a year based on random probabilities.
  - The purpose of this action is explained below.

- Customization Options:
  - To adjust the frequency, administrators can modify the `$MaximumRandom` number or the Baseline evaluation schedule.
  - For interactive testing, `$VerbosePreference` can be set to 'Continue' to observe actions.
  - Remember to revert it to 'SilentlyContinue' for live deployments.

- Event Logging:
  - If a client triggers the action, an EventLog entry with Information EventId 555 from "SyncStateScript" is created.
  - Administrators can customize the `-Message` entry for future tracking, including details like the Configuration Item's name, baseline deployment date, and more.
